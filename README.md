# Beehind
Experiments with using background averaging to see "beehind" the bees in the beehive.

## Description

Experiments using Python and OpenCV to average the frames from footage of a beehive so that I can see the brood, honey and pollen behind the bees. Works perfectly if there are not too many bees in the hive.

## Disclaimer

This code is extremely messy, with a lot of it commented out. I was trying to test out a lot of different background averaging techniques to work with some of the harder videos where I had an extremely dense, slow moving population of bees in the centre of the hive. I may come back to this at a later date, but for now the sections of the code which worked reasonably well have been converted over to C++ and integrated into the main "BeeShiny" program.
